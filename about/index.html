	<h1>About Ryan.</h1>
	<p>I was born and raised in the PNW. I have a family of 4, live in Spokane, WA, am a fan of sports, craft beer, and public health. </p>
	<p>I earned my BS in mechanical engineering from Washington State University in 2012.</p>
  	<p>For the 7ish years after that, I worked in process improvement and project management. I worked on improvements in the areas of manufacturing assemply processes and in health and safety organizational processes and tools. Right before the pandemic, I undertook a career change and started working in clinical quality improvement. Imagine that... going into healthcare at a time like that.</p>
  	<p>Currently, I am working mostly full-time while I pursue my MPH degree. </p>
	<p>I like making things on the web (like this site). It may not be much, but it is here.</p>
