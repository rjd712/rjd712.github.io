*not a static list*

-No one gets prior instructions on how to live life.  

-Absolutes and certainties are probably uncommon.  

-We have 1 life to live (or at least we cannot know otherwise in this life).  
  
-Life is not fair (not a favorite quip of mine, but again, it's probably mostly true). 
  
-Most people live a life full of emotions - good and bad.
