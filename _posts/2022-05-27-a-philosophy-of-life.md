How should we live our life? I am sure, this question and, variations of it, have been asked and answered countless times. Perhaps many of the possible answers are suitable ones. There is probably not a single correct answer. 

I was recently introduced to this idea of a 'philosophy of life' from the book by William B. Irvine, *A Guide to the Good Life*. It is about a reexamination of the philosophy of stoicism as a potential candidate for one's own philosophy of life. 

I won't claim to be a philosopher. At least, not in the sense academics might. I do, however, wish to consider some of the attitudes towards life more purposefully. Explore the ways in which it might make sense to approach different elements of life.
